# Why I Built This

### I made this app while learning Japanese because I wanted a way to store and track my daily active and passive immersion hours. I also wanted all the data in one place so I could generate statistics for each type of activity, providing insights on what I need to focus on more.

### This project is both a learning tool for me and a way to organize and analyze my personal learning habits.
